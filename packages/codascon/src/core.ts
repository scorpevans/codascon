/*
 * codascon — code as config
 *
 * A structural protocol for code organization with exhaustive compile-time type checking.
 *
 * ## Core Concepts
 *
 * **Subject** — An entity that participates in double dispatch. Each Subject
 * declares a unique `resolverName` string literal (e.g. `"resolveStudent"`) which
 * the framework uses to route dispatch to the correct resolver method on a Command.
 * Subjects extend the abstract `Subject` base class.
 *
 * **Command** — An operation that can be performed on Subjects. A Command
 * declares resolver methods — one per Subject in its subject union — each named
 * after that Subject's `resolverName`. The resolver method receives the Subject and
 * the operation's object (context/payload), inspects both, and returns a
 * Template (strategy) to execute. Commands extend the abstract `Command` base
 * class, which provides the `run` method that orchestrates dispatch.
 *
 * **Template** — The strategy interface. A Template declares an `execute`
 * method and optionally declares CommandHooks (references to other Commands
 * that the strategy may invoke during execution). In client code, Templates
 * are typically implemented as abstract classes, with concrete Strategies
 * extending them.
 *
 * **MiddlewareCommand** — A Command subclass that intercepts dispatch.
 * Middleware receives the subject, object, and `inner` (a `Runnable` representing
 * the next step in the chain), and can run logic before and after calling
 * `inner.run()`. Registered at the command level via `Command.middleware`:
 * wraps the full dispatch cycle — resolver method selection and execute —
 * for every Subject. The first element in the array is the outermost layer.
 *
 * ## Dispatch Flow
 *
 * Every command — middleware or not — follows the same two-phase procedure,
 * applied recursively through the chain:
 *
 * ```
 * command.run(subject, object)
 *   → _runChain: for each command in [command.middleware..., command]:
 *       → _dispatch: subject.getCommandStrategy(command, object)
 *           → command[subject.resolverName](subject, object)  // specific resolver, or
 *           → command.defaultResolver                            //   defaultResolver fallback
 *           → returns a Template instance
 *         → strategy.execute(subject, object)           // regular command
 *         → strategy.execute(subject, object, inner)    // middleware command
 *             // inner = continuation: the next step in the enclosing chain
 *   ← chain unwinds, returns R
 * ```
 *
 * Because every step uses `_runChain` / `_dispatch`, middleware registered on
 * a middleware command are automatically applied — no special casing.
 *
 * ## Type Safety Guarantees
 *
 * - **Exhaustive resolver methods**: A Command's `run` method has a `this` parameter
 *   constrained by `CommandSubjectStrategies<C>`, which maps each Subject's
 *   `resolverName` to its required resolver method signature. If any resolver method is
 *   missing, `run` becomes uncallable at the call site.
 *
 * - **`defaultResolver` opt-out**: If a Command defines `defaultResolver`, the
 *   exhaustiveness constraint is relaxed — specific resolver methods become optional.
 *   `defaultResolver` handles every Subject in the union not covered by a specific
 *   resolver method.
 *
 * - **Subject union enforcement**: `run` only accepts Subjects that are in the
 *   Command's declared subject union (`BSL`). Passing an unsupported Subject is
 *   a compile error.
 *
 * - **Literal resolverName**: `SubjectResolverName<S>` returns `never` for non-literal
 *   `string` resolverNames. When `never` is a mapped type key the entry is dropped,
 *   so resolver method requirements for Subjects with non-literal resolverNames are
 *   omitted from `CommandSubjectStrategies` — and `ValidResolverNames`
 *   makes `run` uncallable with a descriptive error property name.
 *
 * - **Duplicate resolverName detection**: If two Subjects in the same Command's
 *   union share a `resolverName`, `CommandSubjectStrategies` produces two entries
 *   with the same key; TypeScript intersects them into an impossible method
 *   signature (e.g. `(s: Dog) => ... & (s: Cat) => ...`), making the visit
 *   method unimplementable.
 *
 * - **Hook presence and subject coverage**: `CommandHooks<H, SU>` requires the
 *   Template to have a property for each hook Command, keyed by `commandName`,
 *   AND enforces that each hook Command declares resolver methods for every Subject
 *   in `SU`. A hook missing any required resolver method resolves to an error string
 *   at the `implements` site — no value of the hook's class satisfies the string
 *   literal type, producing a compile error.
 *
 * ## Client Patterns
 *
 * **Template as abstract class with Strategies:**
 * ```ts
 * abstract class AccessTemplate<SU extends CommandSubjectUnion<AccessCommand>>
 *   implements Template<AccessCommand, [AuditCommand], SU>
 * {
 *   abstract readonly audit: AuditCommand;  // hook — instantiated by Strategy
 *
 *   execute(subject: SU, object: Building): AccessResult {
 *     this.audit.run(subject, { action: "access" });
 *     return this.doAccess(subject, object);
 *   }
 *
 *   protected abstract doAccess(subject: SU, object: Building): AccessResult;
 * }
 *
 * class GrantAccess extends AccessTemplate<Student> {
 *   readonly audit = new AuditCommand();
 *   protected doAccess(s: Student, b: Building) { return { granted: true }; }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Hooks can be:**
 * - Abstract on the Template, instantiated by the Strategy
 * - Concrete on the Template (shared across all Strategies)
 * - Overridden by the Strategy
 * - Injected via constructor during strategy resolution in the Command's resolver method
 *
 * **SU parameterization:**
 * A Template can parameterize its SU (`T<SU extends ...>`), allowing Strategies
 * to narrow which Subjects they handle. This does not break LSP — a
 * `GrantAccess extends AccessTemplate<Student>` is a valid strategy for any
 * dispatch that routes Students to it.
 *
 * **Async support:**
 * Set `R = Promise<Result>` on the Command. Resolver methods (strategy selection)
 * remain synchronous; only `execute` returns the Promise.

/*
 * Abstract base class for all Subjects.
 *
 * A Subject is an entity that participates in double dispatch. Each Subject
 * subclass must declare a `resolverName` as a string literal, which serves as
 * the key for the corresponding resolver method on Commands.
 *
 * ## The `resolverName` Convention
 *
 * By convention, `resolverName` should be prefixed with `"resolve"`:
 * ```ts
 * readonly resolverName = "resolveStudent" as const;
 * ```
 *
 * The `resolverName` must be:
 * - A string literal type (not the wide `string` type) — enforced by
 *   `SubjectResolverName<S>` which returns `never` for non-literals, silently
 *   dropping the resolver method requirement from `CommandSubjectStrategies`.
 *   `ValidResolverNames` separately makes `run` uncallable with a
 *   descriptive error.
 * - Unique across all Subjects used within the same Command's subject union —
 *   duplicates cause `CommandSubjectStrategies` to intersect the conflicting
 *   method signatures, making the resolver method unimplementable.
 *
 * ## The `getCommandStrategy` Method
 *
 * This method performs the Subject's half of double dispatch. When
 * `command.run(subject, object)` is called, it delegates to
 * `subject.getCommandStrategy(command, object)`, which looks up
 * `command[this.resolverName]` and invokes it. If the specific resolver
 * method is absent (the Command assigns `defaultResolver` instead),
 * `defaultResolver` is returned as the Template.
 *
 * Both the specific resolver call (`command[methodName](this, object)`) and the
 * `defaultResolver` fallback preserve the `this` binding on the Command, allowing
 * resolver methods to access Command instance state via `this`.
 *
 * The `this` parameter constraint (`this & BS`) ensures the Subject
 * is part of the Command's subject union. This is automatically satisfied
 * during normal dispatch.
 *
 * @example
 * class Student extends Subject {
 *   readonly resolverName = "resolveStudent" as const;
 *   constructor(
 *     public readonly name: string,
 *     public readonly department: string
 *   ) { super(); }

/*
 * Abstract base class for all Commands.
 *
 * A Command represents an operation that can be performed on a set of Subjects.
 * Subclasses must:
 *
 * 1. Declare `readonly commandName` as a string literal (used for hook keying).
 * 2. Either implement one resolver method per Subject in `BSL` (named after that
 *    Subject's `resolverName`, receiving the Subject and the object, and returning a
 *    Template to execute), or declare `defaultResolver` as a catch-all fallback that
 *    handles every Subject not covered by a specific resolver method.
 *
 * ## Generic Parameters
 *
 * - `B` — Base type. All Subjects in `BSL` must extend `B & Subject`.
 *         Allows constraining Subjects to share a common interface
 *         (e.g. `Person`, `Node`).
 * - `O` — Object type. The context/payload passed to both resolver methods
 *         and `execute`. Available during strategy selection and execution.
 * - `R` — Return type. The result of `execute` and `run`. Use `Promise<T>`
 *         for async Commands.
 * - `BSL` — Subject tuple. The ordered list of Subject types this Command
 *           dispatches to. Each element must extend `B & Subject`. The tuple
 *           drives exhaustive resolver method checking.
 *
 * ## The `run` Method
 *
 * `run` is the public entry point. Internally it delegates to `_runChain`,
 * which applies a unified two-phase procedure to every command in the chain:
 *
 * 1. **`_runChain`** — processes this command's own registered middleware
 *    (first element outermost), then calls `_dispatch` as the terminal step.
 *    Middleware commands are processed identically — their own registered
 *    middleware are applied recursively before their dispatch phase.
 *
 * 2. **`_dispatch`** — calls `subject.getCommandStrategy(this, object)` to
 *    select the strategy, then calls `strategy.execute(subject, object)` for
 *    regular commands. `MiddlewareCommand` overrides `_dispatch` to cast the
 *    strategy to the 3-arg form and forward the continuation as `inner`.
 *
 * Because every step uses `_runChain` / `_dispatch`, middleware registered on
 * a middleware command are automatically applied.
 *
 * The `this` parameter constraint is a union: `this` must satisfy either
 * `CommandSubjectStrategies<...>` (all resolver methods present) OR declare
 * `defaultResolver`. In both cases, all `resolverName`s must be literals.
 *
 * `run` can be overridden by subclasses using `super.run(subject, object)`
 * to unconditionally wrap the chain entry point.
 *
 * ## Resolver Method Semantics
 *
 * Resolver methods are the **strategy selection** phase. They should:
 * - Inspect the Subject's state and the object to choose a strategy
 * - Return a Template instance (which may be a new instance, a singleton,
 *   a shared instance, etc. — client's choice)
 * - NOT mutate the Subject or object (the object parameter is `Readonly`)
 * - Use `this` freely to access Command state, configuration, or injected
 *   dependencies
 *
 * @example
 * class AccessCommand extends Command<Person, Building, AccessResult, [Student, Professor]> {
 *   readonly commandName = "access" as const;
 *
 *   resolveStudent(student: Student, building: Readonly<Building>) {
 *     if (student.department === building.department) return new DepartmentMatch();
 *     return new DenyAccess();
 *   }
 *
 *   resolveProfessor(professor: Professor, building: Readonly<Building>) {
 *     return new GrantAccess();
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * const result = accessCmd.run(student, building);

/*
 * Maps a tuple of hook Commands to an object type keyed by their `commandName`,

 *
 * For each hook Command `Cmd` in `H`, the property type is the intersection
 * `Cmd & { [K in SU["resolverName"] & string]: any }`:
 * - If `Cmd` has all required resolver methods, the intersection is satisfiable
 *   and the implementing class can assign `new Cmd()` normally.
 * - If `Cmd` is missing any resolver method for a Subject in `SU`, the intersection
 *   is unsatisfiable — the `implements` check fails at the declaration site with
 *   a TS2416 error on the hook property.
 *
 * **Coverage check — intersection, not conditional (on `SU`):** A conditional type
 * `Cmd extends { [K in SU["resolverName"]]: any } ? Cmd : "Error"` is deferred
 * by TypeScript when `SU` is a free type parameter (as in abstract parameterized
 * templates). The intersection avoids deferral: `SU["resolverName"]` is an indexed
 * access type, which TypeScript evaluates using `SU`'s constraint — giving a
 * concrete key union even when `SU` is free.
 *
 * **`defaultResolver` opt-out:** A hook Command that declares `defaultResolver` as a
 * required property handles every Subject at runtime regardless of which resolver methods
 * are explicitly declared. For such Commands the intersection check is bypassed entirely
 * via a conditional on `Cmd` (not on `SU`). Because the extends-clause references only
 * `Cmd` — the mapped-type iteration variable, which is always concrete for a concrete `H`
 * tuple — this conditional is evaluated eagerly and does not defer even when `SU` is free.
 * Optional `defaultResolver?` (inherited from the base `Command` class without override)
 * does NOT satisfy `{ readonly defaultResolver: any }`, so Commands that do not explicitly
 * set it still require full resolver-method coverage.
 *
 * `H extends AnyCommand[]` is the constraint. `SU extends CommandSubjectUnion<H[number]>`
 * bounds `SU` to subjects covered by at least one hook Command — `H[number]` collapses
 * the hook tuple to a union before `CommandSubjectUnion` distributes over it.
 *
 * @example
 * // LogCommand handles [Cat, Dog, Bird] — has resolveCat, resolveDog, resolveBird
 * // CommandHooks<[LogCommand], Cat | Dog>:
 * //   LogCommand & { resolveCat: any; resolveDog: any } — satisfied → { log: LogCommand }
 *
 * // CatOnlyCommand handles [Cat] — has resolveCat only
 * // CommandHooks<[CatOnlyCommand], Cat | Dog>:
 * //   CatOnlyCommand & { resolveCat: any; resolveDog: any } — missing resolveDog → TS2416

 * // LogCommand with `readonly defaultResolver = entry` — handles any Subject at runtime
 * // CommandHooks<[LogCommand], Student | Professor>:
 * //   LogCommand (no coverage check) — satisfied even without resolveStudent/resolveProfessor

// ─── Template ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/*
 * The strategy type. Defines the contract for executing a Command's
 * operation on a Subject.
 *
 * A Template combines:
 * - `execute(subject, object)` — the execution logic
 * - `CommandHooks<H, SU>` — structural properties referencing other Commands
 *   that `execute` may invoke, with subject coverage enforced at the `implements` site
 *
 * ## Generic Parameters
 *
 * - `C` — The Command this Template serves. Determines the object type,
 *         return type, and the full subject union.
 * - `H` — Hook tuple. A list of Command types that this Template's `execute`
 *         method may invoke during execution. Each hook Command appears as a
 *         structural property on the Template, keyed by its `commandName`.
 *         Defaults to `[]` (no hooks).
 *
 *         **Important:** `H` should be *provided* (concrete), not parameterized.
 *         A Template class declares its hook requirements in the `implements`
 *         clause:
 *         ```ts
 *         class MyTemplate implements Template<MyCmd, [AuditCmd, LogCmd]> { ... }
 *         ```
 *         The hooks are part of the Template's contract — they are not chosen
 *         by Strategies.
 *
 * - `SU` — Subject Union. The subset of `C`'s subject union that this Template
 *          handles. Defaults to the full union (`CommandSubjectUnion<C>`).
 *
 *          **This CAN be parameterized** on the Template class, allowing
 *          Strategies to narrow which Subjects they handle:
 *          ```ts
 *          abstract class AccessTemplate<SU extends CommandSubjectUnion<AccessCmd>>
 *            implements Template<AccessCmd, [AuditCmd], SU> { ... }
 *
 *          class GrantAccess extends AccessTemplate<Student> { ... }
 *          ```
 *          This does not break LSP — a `GrantAccess` is returned only for
 *          dispatches that route Students to it.
 *
 * ## Client Implementation Patterns
 *
 * Templates are typically implemented as abstract classes when Strategies are
 * needed, or as concrete classes when they serve as both Template and Strategy.
 *
 * **Abstract Template with Strategies:**
 * ```ts
 * abstract class AccessTemplate<SU extends CommandSubjectUnion<AccessCmd>>
 *   implements Template<AccessCmd, [AuditCmd], SU>
 * {
 *   // Hook — concrete (shared across Strategies)
 *   readonly audit = new AuditCommand();
 *
 *   // Or abstract — each Strategy provides its own
 *   // abstract readonly audit: AuditCommand;
 *
 *   execute(subject: SU, object: Building): AccessResult {
 *     this.audit.run(subject, { action: "access" });
 *     return this.doAccess(subject, object);
 *   }
 *   protected abstract doAccess(subject: SU, object: Building): AccessResult;
 * }
 *
 * class GrantAccess extends AccessTemplate<Student> {
 *   protected doAccess(s: Student, b: Building) { return { granted: true }; }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Concrete Template (no Strategies):**
 * ```ts
 * class DenyAccess implements Template<AccessCmd> {
 *   execute(subject: CommandSubjectUnion<AccessCmd>, object: Building): AccessResult {
 *     return { granted: false, reason: "Access denied" };
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Hook ownership rules:**
 * - Template declares which hooks are required (via `H` parameter)
 * - Hooks can be concrete on the Template (shared) or abstract (Strategy provides)
 * - Strategies may override concrete hooks from the Template
 * - Hooks can also be injected via constructor during strategy resolution
 *   in the Command's resolver method
 *
 * **Execute ownership:**
 * - `execute` can be implemented on the Template or left abstract for Strategies
 * - Strategies should exercise caution when overriding a Template's `execute`
 * - The recommended pattern is for the Template to implement `execute` and
 *   delegate to abstract/protected methods that Strategies implement
 *
 * ## Hook Enforcement
 *
 * `CommandHooks<H, SU>` is intersected into the Template type, enforcing two
 * things at the `implements` site:
 *
 * 1. **Presence** — a property must exist for each hook Command, keyed by its
 *    `commandName`. Missing a hook property is a compile error.
 *
 * 2. **Subject coverage** — each hook Command must declare resolver methods for
 *    every Subject in `SU`. The property type is `Cmd & { [K in SU["resolverName"] & string]: any }`;
 *    if `Cmd` is missing any required resolver method, the intersection is unsatisfiable
 *    and the `implements` check fails with TS2416 on the hook property. For example, a
 *    `LogCommand` that only handles `Cat` (declaring only `resolveCat`) cannot satisfy
 *    `Template<C, [LogCommand], Cat | Dog>` because it is missing `resolveDog`.
 *
 * ## Why `execute` (and all callable members) use function property syntax
 *
 * `execute: (...) => R` (function property) rather than `execute(...): R` (shorthand
 * method). TypeScript applies bivariant parameter checking to shorthand methods even under
 * `strictFunctionTypes`: an implementation can silently narrow `object` to a stricter type
 * than the interface declares, making it uncallable with valid inputs. Function property
 * syntax triggers strict (contravariant) checking — a narrower `object` is rejected at the
 * `implements` site with TS2416. The same pattern is applied to `MiddlewareTemplate`,
 * `Runnable`, and the internal default-resolver template types.

 *
 * `inner` is the next command in the middleware chain — call `inner.run(subject, object)`
 * to invoke it, optionally enriching `object` first. `inner` is always defined when
 * invoked as part of a chain. Invoking a `MiddlewareCommand` directly via `run()` is a
 * compile error in well-typed TypeScript and throws at runtime when bypassed — always
 * register middleware via `Command.middleware`.
 *
 * **Note:** TypeScript's fewer-params rule means an `execute` that omits `inner` still
 * satisfies this type — the requirement is not enforced at the implementer's declaration
 * site, but `MiddlewareCommand._dispatch` always passes it.
 *
 * `execute` is declared as a function property — see `Template.execute` for the

/*
 * Abstract base class for middleware Commands.
 *
 * A MiddlewareCommand is a Command that intercepts dispatch. It extends
 * `Command` and follows the same resolver method + Template pattern — each
 * resolver method returns a `MiddlewareTemplate` whose `execute` accepts an
 * `inner` continuation representing the next step in the chain.
 * Calling `inner.run(subject, object)` invokes the continuation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class LogMiddleware extends MiddlewareCommand<Person, Building, Result, [Student, Professor]> {
 *   readonly commandName = "log" as const;
 *   resolveStudent(s: Student, b: Readonly<Building>) { return new LogTemplate(); }

 *     const result = inner.run(subject, object);
 *     console.log("after", result);
 *     return result;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Registration
 *
 * Override `Command.middleware` to return a list of `MiddlewareCommand` instances.
 * The middleware wraps every dispatch through the Command — resolver method selection
 * and execute — for all Subjects.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * The first middleware in the array is outermost — starts first, finishes last.
 * `[auth, log, trace]` means `auth` wraps everything: auth → log → trace → dispatch.
 *
 * ## Object enrichment
 *
 * Middleware can forward a modified object to the continuation:
 * ```ts
 * execute(subject, object, inner) {
 *   return inner.run(subject, { ...object, timestamp: Date.now() });
 * }
 * ```
 * The subject is fixed across the chain — dispatch routes on subject type,
 * so passing a different subject to `inner.run()` would re-route to that
 * subject's resolver in the next chain step, which is rarely intended. Only
 * the object should be enriched.
 *
 * For the spread to typecheck, `O` must declare the enrichment slot as
 * optional:
 * ```ts
 * type Ctx = { factor: number; timestamp?: number };
 * //                          ^^^^^^^^^^
 * ```
 * Strategies that do not use the slot simply ignore it. Enrichment fields
 * belong in `O` — they are part of the command's contextual contract.
 *
 * **Limitation — enrichment is not type-checked end-to-end.** The framework
 * uses a single `O` type throughout the chain: `run`, middleware `execute`,
 * and strategy `execute` all see the same `O`. TypeScript has no way to
 * express that middleware has narrowed `O` to `O & { slot: T }` by the time
 * the strategy runs. Strategies that rely on middleware-supplied fields must
 * cast (`object as O & { slot: T }`) — this documents the runtime contract
 * but is not enforced at the call site. A framework-level fix would require
 * splitting `O` into separate input (`O_in`) and enriched (`O_out`) type
 * parameters, which is a deeper design change.
 *
 * ## Standalone invocation
 *
 * Invoking a `MiddlewareCommand` directly via `run()` is a **compile error**:
 * `MiddlewareCommand.run()` is declared with `this: never`, making it uncallable
 * on any instance from well-typed TypeScript. If bypassed (JavaScript, `any`-typed
 * code), a runtime error is also thrown. Always register middleware via
 * `Command.middleware`.

   * The cast is required because `getCommandStrategy` returns

   * `MiddlewareTemplate<MiddlewareCommand<B, O, R, BSL>, any[], SU>` tells
   * TypeScript the strategy's execute has the 3-arg form. This is safe because
   * `MiddlewareSubjectStrategies` (enforced at `Command.middleware` assignment)
   * guarantees any registered middleware's resolvers return `MiddlewareTemplate`-
   * compatible values.
   *
   * Do not call this method directly. It is only safe when called from
   * `_runChain`, which always passes `continuation`. Bypassing `_runChain`
   * and calling `_dispatch` without a continuation will cause the
   * `continuation!` non-null assertion to panic at runtime.
